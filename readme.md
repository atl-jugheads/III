# [Gitter](https://gitter.im/atl-jugheads/Lobby)

The Jupyter User Group uses __Gitter__ during each meeting to record information, comments, and questions.  

> We ask the speakers to open 
__Gitter__ in their browser and [enable notifications](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210265505-Notifications);
this way the audience can interact with the speaker during their talk.
